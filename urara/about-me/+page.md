# About me

My name is **Vo Tien Dung**

Yes, you did not get it wrong, my name is "Dung". In Vietnamese, "Dung" stands for courage, brave. You can spell my name exactly like "Dzung", for the fellows who know Chinese or is a Chinese, my name is also pronounce exactly like "brave" in Chinese (from my labmate).

Currently, I am working as a Research Engineer at Singapore Management University with the focus on Multi-agent conversational systems. Previously, I am a data scientist at Be Group JSC - a ride-hailing company like Grab or Uber but in a smaller scale. Before joining Be Group, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Moreh. My first ever job is doing academic research at FPT Software AI Residency with the focus on Neural Differential Equations and a little bit about Graph.

My main research interest currently lies on the intersection between the **Optimization** and **Machine Learning**, sometimes I am really like to explore on the **Probabilistic Machine Learning**. Because of being a research and also engineer, I have a wide rage of skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and a little bit experience on MLOps and related stuffs.

# Hobbies

I love doing cool things such as:

- [x] Reinstalling my computer with Arch Linux

# About the blog

As always, the blog is migrated from the old one, so it will stayed the same with the initial idea. I build this blog for sharing knowledge, ideas, research. But now, there will be some posts regarding to my PhD journey. I am trying the best to get at least one offer this year and if not; I will try to get many in the following year.
